# crscl -- Contains a Reimplementation of a Subset of Common Lisp

This is an old library that contains... well, you read the title.

At a minimum, this library can be seen as a "portable" *S-exps*
facility.

The library was used for a couple of *complex* C systems, SHIFT (the
first *Hybrid System* simulator) and VAL (an early bioinformatics tool
used to "validate" sequence assembly and therefore assemblers).  Those
systems were complex pieces of code, hence Greenspun's Tenth applies.

# A NOTE ON FORKING

Of course you are free to fork the project subject to the current
licensing scheme.  However, before you do so, I ask you to consider
plain old "cooperation" by asking me to become a developer.
It helps keeping the entropy level at an acceptable level.
